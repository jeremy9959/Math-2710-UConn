## Uniqueness Proofs

Claiming something is "unique" means there is only one thing of that type.

**Proposition:** There is a unique real number $a$ such that $a>0$ and $a^2=1$. 

There are two claims here:

- There exists a real number $a$ such that $a^2=1$ and $a>0$.

- There is *only one* real number with these properties.

## Uniqueness proofs

Proofs typically go like this.

**Theorem:** There exists a unique $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true. 

**Proof:** First, we show that there is an $x$ such that $P(x)$ is true. Now suppose
that $u$ and $v$ are two things such that $P(u)$ and $P(v)$ are true.  Then we show that $u=v$.

**Proposition:** Suppose $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers.  Then there exists a unique $d\in\mathbb{N}$ so that
$m$ is a multiple of $d$ if and only if $m=ax+by$ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$. 

Notice the logical structure here.  We must show:

- there is (at least one) $d$ that makes the if and only if statement
"$m$ is a multiple of $d$ if and only if $m=ax+by$ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$"
true.

- then show that there is *at most one* $d$ that has this property.

**Proposition:** Suppose $a$ and $b$ are natural numbers.  Then there exists a unique $d\in\mathbb{N}$ so that
$m$ is a multiple of $d$ if and only if $m=ax+by$ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$. 

##

**Step 1A:** Let $d=\gcd(a,b)$.  

The goal is to show that

$$
d|m \Leftrightarrow m=ax+by\hbox{\rm\ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$}
$$

- We will show that $d$ makes the if and only if statement true.  

- First we show that $d|m\implies m=ax+by$ for some $x$ and $y$. 

- Suppose that $m$ is a multiple of $d$, so $m=dg$.  

- We know that $d=ak+bl$, so $m=dg=a(gk)+b(gl)$. 

- Choosing
$x=gk$ and $y=gl$ we see that there exist $x$, $y$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ so that $m=ax+by$

**Step 1B:** 

Remember:

$$
d|m \Leftrightarrow m=ax+by\hbox{\rm\ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$}
$$


- Now we show that $m=ax+by$ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$ implies that $d|m$. 

- We know that $a=ud$ and $b=vd$ for some
$u$ and $v$ in $\mathbb{N}$.  

- Therefore $m=udx+vdy=d(ux+vy)$ so $m$ is a multiple of $d$.

##

**Step 2A:** 

- Now we must show that $d=\gcd(a,b)$ is the *only* integer $g$ that makes the if and only if statement

$$
g|m \Leftrightarrow m=ax+by\hbox{\rm\ for some $x,y\in\mathbb{Z}$}
$$

of the theorem true.  Our strategy is to suppose we have another integer $d'$ that has this property, and
then prove $d\ge d'$ and $d\le d'$.  So suppose that  $d'$ makes the if and only if statement true. 

- Now we show $d'\le d$.  

- The if and only if statement tells us that $d'|a$ since $a=a(1)+b(0)$
and $d'|b$ since $b=a(0)+b(1)$.  

- Therefore $d'$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$, and so $d'\le d$.

##

**Step 2B:**

- Next we show $d\le d'$. 

- Since $d'|d'$, we can find $x$ and $y$ so that $d'=ax+by$.  

- Since $a=ud$ and $b=vd$ for some integers $u$ and $v$, we get $d'=d(ux+by)$ so $d|d'$ so $d'\ge d$.  

- Combining Steps 2A and 2B we see that $d'=d$.
