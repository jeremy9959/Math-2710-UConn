# Permutations

## Factorials

**Definition 1:** For $n\in\mathbb{Z}$, $n \ge 0$, define $0!=1$ and $n!=(1)(2)\cdots(n-1)(n)$.  Alternatively,
define $n!$ for non-negative integers $n$ by setting $0!=1$ and $n!=n(n-1)!$. 

**Proposition:** The number of different lists of length $n$ made up of elements from the set $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$,
*without repetitions*, is $n!$.

## Permutations

**Definition:** Let $X$ be a set.  A permutation of $X$ is a list of length $|X|$ of the elements of $X$,
without repetition.  (**Note:** There are other definitions of permutations in other contexts, all related
to this one).

**Examples:**

**Definition:** Let $X$ be a set.  A $k$-permutation of $X$ is a list of $k$ elements of $X$ without repetition.
$P(n,k)$ is the number of $k$ permutations of a set with $n$ elements. 


**Proposition:** The number $P(n,k)$ of $k$-permutations of a set with $n$ elements is $n(n-1)\cdots (n-k+1)$
or, equivalently
$$
P(n,k) = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}
$$

**Proof:**

## Examples of $k$-permutations

(Problem 7, page 84) How many $9$-digit numbers can be made from the digits $1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9$ if
repetition is not allowed and all the odd digits occur first, followed by all the even digits.

(Problem 15, page 84) In a club of 15 people, there is a president, vice-president, secretary, and treasurer.
In how many different ways can this be done?
